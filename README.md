## New Products Revamp üöÄ

Exciting news! I'm currently revamping and preparing to launch three new micro-frontend (MFE) applications. These applications will be hosted for free on GitHub Pages, bringing modern web development solutions to the forefront of innovation.

### Upcoming MFE Applications:
- [Pok√©monEdutainment](https://vipulroxx.github.io) - This application fuses the enchanting world of Pok√©mon with innovative educational content. This app is designed to revolutionize learning by offering a unique and immersive experience that captivates users of all ages. By seamlessly integrating Pok√©mon lore with educational modules, trivia challenges, real-world exploration, and personalized learning paths, the app aims to make learning enjoyable, personalized, and globally accessible.
- [Architectures](https://vipulroxx.github.io) - This application explains the various solution architecture implementations I have done along with different other ideas related to modern decentralized quantum-ai infrastructure that I encounter along my journey.

Stay tuned for updates as I continue to enhance and deploy these applications. Feel free to explore my portfolio projects and reach out if you have any questions or collaboration ideas!
